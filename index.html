      <h2>Focus on environmental and societal issues</h2>
      <p>With the continued rise in global temperatures, the consequences of climate change could become more severe. This might include extreme weather events, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, and resource scarcity, leading to significant social and economic disruptions. Also, the gap between the rich and the poor might widen, leading to social unrest, lack of access to basic needs, and unequal distribution of resources and opportunities.</p>
      <h2>Overthink</h2>
      <p>When faced with a situation, immediately assume the worst possible outcome. Exaggerate the potential consequences in your mind. For example, if a friend is late, instead of assuming they got caught in traffic, immediately assume they've had a terrible accident.</p>

      <h2>Regulating emotions</h2>
      <p>Do not challenge negative or irrational thoughts. Question the validity of these thoughts and let yourself get more and more anxious. Do not try to relax and start breathing as rapidly as possible.</p>
